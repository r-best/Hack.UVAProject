========
A simple puzzle based game; you have the ability to teleport short distances and stop time, 
however both of these actions consume energy, which slowly regenerates over time.

The game will start slowly, but the longer you play the faster enemies will start to appear; the goal
is to reach the end of the level before you are overwhelmed. In the time I had I was only able to 
implement two types of enemies: one that chases you around and another that stays stationary and
fires projectiles in your direction.

In time I should be able to implement a larger variety of enemies and challenges, as well as more interesting puzzles.
